# KotlinCatchGame_Basic

In this very basic Catch the Smiley game you are trying to click as many as you can on the smiley faces within the time you are given. 
To start the game you must choose the game difficulty first. When you click the difficulty you want to game will start automatically. Here are some screenshots
from the app. I am trying to develop basic apps to improve myself in Kotlin language and mobile development area. I will be happy to hear feedbacks.
